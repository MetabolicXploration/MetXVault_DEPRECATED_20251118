## INTRODUCTION

In an earlier volume, Monod (91) wrote that reviewing the study of bacterial growth entirely would be "a foolish enterprise, and doomed to failure" an observation as accurate and appropriate today as in 1949. The current review deals specifically, therefore, with studies relating available energy to yields of cells from growth of heterotrophic bacteria and yeasts in both aerobic and anaerobic cultures, and in both simple and complex media.

N u tri tion in the generally accepted sense will not be considered here but was the subject of a fairly recent review (48) . Much has been written about minimal nutritional requirements and the reliability of quantitative growth responses of fastidious heterotrophs and auxotrophic mutants to graded concentrations of micronutrients in otherwise complete media. A great part of analytical microbiology is based on the precision of the responses made by these demanding organisms (70) . This paper will deal, instead, with studies of influences exerted on growth by energy sources supplied in greater bulk,

and will be further concerned, in large measure, with growth of nutritionally nondemanding microorganisms in both pure and mixed cultures, as well as a few of the fastidious types.

The exact and reproducible correlation between the quantity of an energy-yielding substrate consumed in culture and the dry weight of cells derived has yet to be exploited as thoroughly as Monod (90), van Niel (141), and Herbert (55) have suggested it might. For example, the property has not been adapted to quantitative analysis, although application is promising (24, 110, 119, 120) in this and other fields.

Recently, practical interest in growth yields has been quickening as the prospect of commercial production of microorganisms as food and fodder comes closer to reality. That interest, and the anticipation of gaining better insight into the physiology of microbial growth, would both be well served and rewarded by the derivation and testing of predictive factors for use in relating quantity of substrate energy to yield. Three such yield factors have emerged (8, 84, 85), and a sufficient number of results are now available to permit critical review of their acceptability. Specifically, the following will be examined: (i) yields of cells per mole of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) formed during growth (YATP) j (ii) yields per electron initially available in the substrate for transfer to oxygen or incorporation into cellular material (Yav e-); and (iii) yields per kilocalorie of total energy taken by both assimilation and dissimilation from the medium during growth (Ykcal). Except where noted, data for the maximal yields obtained have been employed with no concern for influences that might be noted if maintenance energy (109) were considered or if some component(s) other than energy source were made limiting (134).

### OXIDATIVE ASSIMILATION OF SUBSTRATE CARBON AND ELECTRONS

Many earlier studies of concomitant oxidation and assimilation of the carbon of organic compounds were performed with nonproliferating cells. Washed suspensions of Escherichia coli (26) and Pseudomonas saccharophila (12) were found in manometric experiments to oxidize a greater fraction of the carbon of the sugars and organic acids provided than they assimilated. In certain of the experiments, as much as two-thirds to three-fourths of the substrate carbon was oxidized by washed suspensions of bacteria, and no more than one-third to one-fourth was assimilated (27). In other experiments (35), the quantity of carbon oxidized varied widely with the substrates utilized. It thus appeared that growth of prototrophs in minimal medium might require a major and possibly unpredictable expenditure of the carbon source for energy, with only a relatively poor return in assimilation.

This misapprehension was dispelled by Siegel & Clifton who found that, when E. coli was suspended in a minimal (but nutritionally adequate) basal salts-glucose medium which enabled the bacteria to prolifel-ate, the relationship was changed (121). In these growing cultures, the fraction of the carbon

oxidized was less, rather than more, than the portion assimilated. The most significant observation from these experiments was the near constancy of the ratio of the quantity of carbon assimilated to the total quantity of carbon removed from the culture medium by combined oxidation and assimilation. During several short periods of time, as growth proceeded, the ratio of carbon assimilated to carbon utilized was 0.56-0.60. This consistency was observed whether assimilation was measured during the lag, one half-hour after initiation of the experiment, between 4 and 4.5 hr when growth had reached the logarithmic phase, or during other intervals between these two extremes. The remainder of the substrate carbon was budgeted for oxidation.

Additionally consistent observations were obtained by Herbert (55) in studies of the growth of Aerobacter aerogenes and Aerobacter cloacae in continuous culture. The "output" of cells was found to be directly porportional to the quantity of glycerol utilized, assuming perfect mixing over a wide range of dilution rates. Moreover, 61 percent of the carbon of the glycerol utilized was assimilated in the syn thesis of cells.

With the requirements for proper rate of dilution and perfect mixing met, Herbert (55) concluded that this simple expression is valid:

$$\mathbf{r} = -\frac{dx}{ds}$$

where Y is yield in grams dry weight of cells (x) obtained per gram of substrate (s) consumed. He added that deviations have been seen in the responses of E. coli and Torula utilis when the growth rates were low or the ammonia concentration in the minimal medium was limiting. Much more elaborate mathematical treatment was proposed to accommodate these deviations and was found to fit the experimentally derived data quite well. The superiority of continuous culture as an analytical method for experiments of this type was noted.

Recent studies (84) with aerobic pseudomonads have revealed a very close agreement between (i) a ratio based on measurement of uptake of available electrons from the substrate molecule and (ii) Siegel & Clifton (121) and Herbert's (55) ratio for carbon utilization. The ratio of the number of substrate electrons assimilated to the total of those utilized was found to lie in the range 0.58-0.65. To calculate this ratio, the number of available electrons per mole of substrate must be known for each organic substrate and may be determined by (i) measuring the number of moles of oxygen consumed in the complete combustion of one mole of the compound of interest, and (ii) multiplying by four (which is the number of electrons required to reduce one mole of oxygen). Glucose may thus be considered a 24-electron compound. Actually, empirical estimation of this value for many compounds is unnecessary, for Kharasch (71, 72) has calculated and tabulated the number of available electrons characteristic of a great number of organic compounds. Using his figures for reckoning, it was found (84) that soil pseudomonads growing aerobically on simple carbon sources in minimal mineral

media assimilated the following ratios of available substrate electrons to the total number utilized: from benzoate, 0.58; phenylglyoxylate, 0.64; phenylacetate, 0.61; acetate, 0.59; succinate, 0.60; acetate + succinate, 0.65; 1-dodecanol, 0.60; di-, tri- and tetraethylene glycols, 0.64.

Consistent values were reported as well by MacKechnie & Dawes (78) who observed that growing Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells oxidized to CO2 an average of 41.6 percent of the carbon of glucose, 40.75 percent of gluconate and 36.35 percent of 2-oxo-gluconate when these substrates were supplied as sole carbon and energy sources in a minimal medium. The remainder of each was assimilated.

### OXIDATIVE ASSIMILATION IN MIxED POPULATIONS

Additionally impressive evidence of the closeness of fit to approximately 0.6 of the ratio of substrate carbon assimilated to total utilized is found in studies of the aerobic growth of mixed cultures of soil and sewage bacteria at the expense of known quantities of "pure biochemicals" (24, 119, 120). In the Formal Discussion of McCarty's paper in the Proceedings of the Second International Water Pollution Research Conference (86), Eckenfelder (37) presented a plot relating grams of cells per mole of substrate and grams CODl per mole of substrate utilized to show that Siegel & Clifton's data (121) from studies with E. coli and the values obtained by Servizi & Bogan (119) for yields of cells in mixed cultures constitute one straight-line function. Even with complex substrates (skim milk powder, casein, lactose) the microorganisms in activated sludge have been found to oxidize 32-43 percent of the carbon and to incorporate the remainder (62).

Busch (23) observed that maximal microbial growth ("solids production") occurred in sewage supplemented with glucose when (i) all of the sugar was utilized, and (ii) enough oxygen was consumed to indicate that 41 percent of the total had been oxidized. So dependable was this latter figure in a number of repetitions that it was then proposed (24, 47) that calculations based on this value (which can be easily and Quickly determined) might well be employed as the standard for estimation of BOD2 in preference to waiting five days for an answer, as the most widely used method now necessitates.

Considering all these studies of oxidative assimilation, it thus appears that we can predict the following with a high degree of probability: during either pure or mixed culture of those types of bacteria which totally consume organic substrates when they are grown in minimal medium, and whose only products are cells, CO2, and water, there will be a budgeting of substrate carbon and electrons into two categories. Approximately 40 percent (± 5) will be marked for oxidation, and the complementary quantity for assimila-

2 Biological oxidation demand (grams of 0, required to degrade to a biologically irreducible minimum a gram of carbonaceous substrate).

tion. But the question of the level at which the budgets are controlled is yet to be answered.

#### SUBSTRATE CONCENTRATION AND CELL YIELD

Monod (90) demonstrated that the total cell yield for several aerobically grown heterotrophic bacterial species was linearly proportional over a wide range to the quantity of either meat extract supplied as a complex nutrient or carbohydrate provided as a simple nutrient in a basal salts medium. Later, growth of lactic acid bacteria was found by turbidimetric evidence to be precisely related to the quantity of carbohydrate added to a rich, complex medium; and yields of Streptococcus faecalis, measured as grams dry weight of cells, were shown to be constantly related to the concentration of glucose or gluconate in the medium (31). The growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was found to be linearly related as well to graded quantities of glucose, ethanol, and acetic acid supplied in minimal medium(S). Observations of this sort are now commonplace.

The precision of this consistent response is not simple to explain, however. It is clear that demands made upon the molecules of energy-yielding substrates during the growth of fermentative bacteria are much less complicated than those exacted by growth of aerobic prototrophs. Glucose, gluconate, and related substrates are utilized either exclusively or predominantly for generation of energy during fermentations, but serve in addition as the sole sources of carbon for biosynthesis during prototrophic growth. Stoichiometric accounting for fermentation products has long assured that carbon is assimilated almost entirely as a constituent of the preformed compounds that must be provided in the complex medium for fastidious bacteria. Little, in some cases none, of the carbon is likely to be derived from the degradation products of the fermented energy sources. Convincing evidence in support of this assumption was provided by Bauchop & Elsden (8) who demonstrated that less than 1 percent of the labeled carbon was incorporated into the cells when S. faecalis was cultured in a medium containing HC-Iabeled glucose.

From the time of the earlier, relatively less complicated experiments, research in this field has become much more complex. Interest has been intensified in the investigation of influences of substrate concentration on aerobic growth. A review of the development of a kinetic theory of nutrientlimited responses during balanced exponential growth has now been published (142) with special reference to mathematical treatment of data from analyses of continuous cultures.

Gunsalus & Shuster (49) suggested that analysis of yields from aerobic growth might profitably be correlated with uptake of oxygen and transfer of electron pairs. Reviewing unpublished data from Storck & Stanier (129) on turbidimetric measurements of growth of Pseudomonas jluorescens, these workers further suggested that the "22 units of growth difference" between the yield obtained from growth on succinate over that on fumarate might

reflect the greater quantity of energy made available by transfer of the additional electron pair supplied by each mole of succinate. The energy available from the transport of specific numbers of electrons has since become a very significant factor in the calculation of yields (84, 85, 123, 130).

# THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSES PURE CULTURES

Applicability of thermodynamic principles to microbial growth has been recognized for many years. Earlier attempts to associate the second law with the dynamic components of growth revealed that, if significant calculations are to be made, the phenomenon must have explicitly defined initial and final states (6, 7,61, 147). Battley suggested that the initial state should comprise the enthalpy represented by the components of the growth medium and at least one cell (5) and, further, that the final state should be characterized by exhaustion of the substrate. To test this hypothesis, a strict accounting was obtained from cultures of S. cerevisiae for carbon expended from the medium and recovered in the cells and the end products. There was simultaneous accounting for the moles of oxygen consumed during growth. These quantities then formed the bases for chemical equations representing initial and final states for aerobic growth systems. Anaerobic systems were assayed and represented by equations as well. Subsequently, growth of the yeasts was defined as a conservative reaction because much of the enthalpy of substrate was retained in forming the cells. A nonconservative reaction was defined as one in which maximum change occurred in enthalpy, free energy, and entropy, e.g., in systems where assimilation was inhibited with 2,4-dinitrophenol (6).

Battley (7) made use of the second law of thermodynamics to further support his suggestion that free energy conserved is proportional to free energy available. Although he failed to act on his own advice, Battley suggested that examination of thermodynamic properties of growth could best be accomplished if the only significant product formed were cellular material. Data obtained from experiments with the strain of S. cerevisiae he employed were difficult to interpret because of the incomplete transformation of glucose to ethanol and CO2 • Glycerol phosphate was discerned as well. Prototrophic heterotrophs would seem best suited for this type of work and have been chosen by other workers (84, 94). Battley.predicted, however, that if all products could be accounted for, cellular and otherwise, efficiency of conservation of free energy should be the same whether the cultures under investigation were aerobic or anaerobic (7). Theoretically, he then concluded, assays of the amount of growth obtained with an organism on one substrate of known energy content should provide the basis for predicting the quantity of growth that would be obtained on another substrate. A number of studies since conducted are consistent with that conclusion (85, 123, 130).

In later investigations concerned particularly with the sufficiency of en-

tropy rather than estimates of enthalpy and free energy, Morowitz (94) assumed that the initial and final stages of growth called for by Battley could be stated as:

## n utrients ---t cells + waste products

He omitted Battley's single cell (5) on the left of the equation, assuming that it acts as a catalyst and not as a principal constituent. Estimates were then obtained by Morowitz of both the number of molecules of nutrients (glucose, NHa, HaPO., and O2) utilized by E. coli growing in a simple medium and the number of end product molecules formed (C02, acetic acid, and water). The second law of thermodynamics was applied with the stipulation that the entropy change must be greater than or equal to zero for the synthesis of cells. He considered four aspects of entropy. Two of these, the condensation and ordering of nutrient molecules within the cell, were presumed to decrease entropy. The other two, the conversion of nutrients to waste and the transfer of heat during growth, were deemed likely to increase entropy. An equation was devised and tested for determining an entropy factor f (the minimum number of grams of waste products released per gram of cells produced). Estimates of the number and variety of covalent bonds comprising the constituents of both the medium and the cells were established and used to supply values for each parameter in the equation. From these, a value of 0.03 was reckoned to be the minimum possible for f in a growing culture. But, in actuality, f was found to be a much larger number. Drawing on other studies of cells growing in complex rather than simple media, Morowitz (93) concluded that E. coli actually produced 3.3 times the minimal entropy required to balance the specifications of the second law as applied to growth.

According to a number of workers (7, 61, 93, 147) who have analyzed microbial cultures, and Odum (104) who has evaluated the energetics of various ecosystems, transformation of the energy of substrate molecules into cells and end products can be shown in every case to proceed in accord with the second law of thermodynamics. In light of this possibility, Mayberry, Prochazka & Payne (84) set up a thermodynamic model for growth of prototrophic heterotrophs in minimal media. They used (i) the average value for the energy per available electron of 18 representative organic compounds, and (ii) the mean yield of cells from aerobic cultures of their soil pseudomonads to provide approximations of enthalpy (�H) and free energy (�F), respectively. Enthalpy was taken as the heat of combustion of the organic compounds and was calculated (71, 72) to average 26.5 kcal per available electron (av e-). Bomb calorimetry was then employed to ascertain the heat of combustion of dried cells that had been grown aerobically on minimal media (mean value: 5.3 kcal per gram dry weight of bacteria). It was assumed that free energy for this system could be taken as the fraction of the enthalpy conserved in the composition of the cells. Since the mean yield for aerobic!bacteria from!cultures!grown in minimal media was found to be

3.14 grams per av e-, free energy was considered to be approximately [3.14 gX (av e-)-l] X (5.3 kcal Xg-l) or 16.6 kcal X (av e-)-l.

Further, stating the second law in this fashion,

$$
\Delta H - \Delta F = T\Delta S
$$

it was assumed that the entropy term for aerobic growth of these pseudo monads can be approximated by this substitution: (26.5-16.6) or 9.9 kcal X (av e-)-l. Thus, 62 percent of the enthalpy of an organic substrate is likely to be conserved by bacteria growing in minimal mineral salts media at the expense of a simple carbon source. This figure falls within the range (55-65 percent) of substrate carbon which E. coli (121), A. aerogenes and A. cloacae (55, 56) and mixed populations in sewage sludge (119, 120) were found to assimilate. Actually, these findings would be anticipated in light of even earlier findings-the 60 percent efficiency of energy conversion by molds that was observed by Terroine & Wurmser (135) in 1922. (These workers suggested even then that the same might be demonstrated to be true for yeasts and bacteria, if there were some more effective means of harvesting those cells. As we have seen, their prediction was correct.) Of further interest is the inclusion of this figure within the range of 51-65 percent of gross efficiency of energy conversion reported for the prenatal growth of the chick, silk worm, and sea urchin (13).

### MIXED MICROFLORA

On the strength of Bauchop & Elsden's (8) association of ATP production and cell yield, Servizi & Bogan (119) proposed that yields of microbial cells in activated sludge would bear this relation to ATP production:

$$Y = k_1 N_{\mathbf{ATT}}$$

where Y is yield in grams per mole of substrate, kl a proportionality constant and NATP the energy becoming available from the catabolism of the mole of substrate. Further, NATP was assumed to be proportional to the "free energy of oxidation" (AFo,,) of the substrate as follows:

$$N_{\rm ATP} = -k_2 \Delta F_{ox}$$

where k2 is a second proportionality factor. AFo:e might actually be considered heat of combustion or AH (23) ; but the terminology does not detract from the hypothesis, and values were derived to permit the testing of it. Probable molar values for the quantity of ATP that could arise from oxidation of molar quantities of glucose and other substrates were obtained by the authors from the biochemical literature to supply a figure for NATP. Parenthetically, it should be noted that this necessity to speculate on the number of moles of ATP that can be realized from aerobic catabolism represents the greatest impediment to experimental determination of YATP for aerobes. By substitution, however, the following relationship was postulated:

$$Y = -\
{_{k1}k_2 \Delta F^{\bullet}}{}_{\bullet \bullet}$$

where !::..F".", is only very slightly different in physiological concentrations from !::..Foz• Mixed cultures were then grown aerobically on single carbon sources and yields in dry weight of cells were determined. Employing these experimentally determined values for Y and generally accepted heats of combustion of a number of organic compounds to calculate!::..Fooz, substituting in the equation and solving for klk2, these workers obtained a value of 0.104 grams of cells per kcal for growth on aromatics, alcohols, and aliphatic acids and 0.116 for growth on carbohydrates and Krebs cycle intermediates [It will be shown later that these yield values based in part on assumed. figures for NATP are very nearly identical with experimentally derived figures (84, 85)].

Since !::"F"oz for a substrate is related to number of moles of O2 consumed in oxidizing one mole (Z), !::"F"oz was equated to -kaZ. Thus:

$$Y = k_1 k_2 k_3 Z$$

and Z is actually the COD. Substituting again, Servizi & Bogan presented these equations for yields of sludge:

$$Y = 0.38 \times \text{cond}$$

for carbohydrates and TCA cycle intermediates and:

$$Y = 0.32 \times \text{cond}$$

for aromatic and aliphatic acids.

Because activated sludge organisms are not likely, as a practical matter, to grow in single organic compounds, Servizi & Bogan (120) later suggested this expression:

$$Y = \left. - \left. h_1 h_2 \frac{\Sigma M \Delta F^{\Theta}_{\text{on}}}{\Sigma M} \right| \right.$$

as broadly applicable, with M representing the various organic components of the substrate mixture.

McCarty (86) has taken note of the loss of energy implicit in these mathematical models of the behavior of the organisms in mixed cultures of activated sludge and other sewage treatment procedures. This loss was properly attributed to inefficiencies in both synthesis and utilization of ATP and to requirements for expenditure of maintenance energy during prolonged culturing, whether aerobic or anaerobic. Formulation of mathematical models for waste disposal is likely to remain imprecise owing to the complex ingredients encountered by microorganisms in sewage and industrial waste; but measurement of oxygen consumption by microorganisms in sludge and quantitation of the conversion of substrates to cellular material by bacterial metabolism seem to offer the most useful means of assessing effectiveness.

#### MOLAR GROWTH YIELDS

# YATP-BAUCHOP & ELSDEN VALUE

Employing tryptophan and glucose limitations in the culture medium to influence the anaerobic growth of S. faecalis, Rosenberger & Elsden (115) learned that the nutritional requirements for synthesis during cell proliferation did not control the rate at which energy-yielding. metabolism proceeded. Subsequently, Bauchop & Elsden (8) found that the yields in grams dry weight of cells obtained from anaerobic growth of S. faecalis, S. cerevisiae, and Pseudomonas lindneri (Zymomonas mobilis) were directly proportional to moles of ATP produced per mole of energy source catabolized. These YATP values averaged 10.5 g of cells per mole of ATP generated-with the range 8.3 to 12.6. The figure 9.3 derived from earlier studies by Sokatch & Gunsalus (126) was included in this reckoning by Bauchop & Elsden together with their own values. Calculation of molar ATP production was based on prior knowledge (45, 64, 75, 148) of pathways employed by the microorganism for the catabolism of glucose, ribose, and arginine.

As might be expected, molar growth yields from anaerobic cultures have since been used by a number of investigators to evaluate probable ATP production by a variety of bacteria. For those interested in this type of evaluation, Stouthamer (131) has now provided a review of methods employed in studies of molar growth yields.

Many of the data obtained are in accord with Bauchop & Elsden. An impressive list of values falling close to 10.5 for YATP can be assembled for a variety of anaerobes as well as a number of facultative organisms grown anaerobically. For example, the average YATP for Desulfovibrio desulfuricans grown on pyruvate and lactate was reported to be 9. 6 (118) with either sulfate or sulfite supplied as terminal oxidant. Goddard & Sokatch (46) observed a YATP of 9.8 for S. faecalis grown on gluconate. In studies that revealed butyryl phosphate as the main energy source for Clostridium tetanomorphum in the fermentation of histidine and glutamate, accounting for the equivalents of ATP generated as the sum of those resulting from both a phosphoroc1astic attack on pyruvate and the action of acetokinase, Twarog & Wolfe (138) obtained a YATP of 10.9. Bulder (19, 20) rcportcd valucs avcraging 11.6 for Saccharomyces rosei.

Evaluation of the energy-yielding utilization of glucose by Lactobacillus plantarum (105), which is known to derive two moles of ATP per mole of glucose fermented, resulted in a molar growth yield of 18.8, and thus a YATP of 9.4. De Vries & Stouthamer (32) computed YATP values in the range 9.9 to 13.1 (averaging 11.3) for the fermentation of glucose, galactose, lactose, and mannitol by Bifidobacterium bifidum. The presence of enzymes consistent with the pathways they postulated to explain the production of ATP was demonstrated in extracts of the bacteria. Ljungdahl & Wood (76) obtained a YATP of 10 for Clostridium thermoaceticum, which produced 20 g of cells and a net of 2 moles of ATP per mole of glucose fermented. Similarly,

Andreesen (1) reported YATP values of 10 for growth of Clostridium aceticum on fructose, 10.8 on gluconate, and 12.8 on pyruvate. Studies with Z. mobilis (11) have provided a YATP value of 8.6.

Rather than simply measuring YATP, Thauer et al (136) employed an approximation of Senez's figure (YATP = 9, rather than 10.5) for their calculations of moles of ATP gained by Clostridium kluyveri utilizing ethanol, acetate, bicarbonate, and crotonate in a minimal medium. They reasoned that 9 was more appropriate to their experiments than 10.5. since they, like Senez, were employing an unsupplemented medium. They were then able to conclude that the ATP needed for growth is generated in C. kluyveri by substrate-level phosphorylation, with acetyl phosphate as key intermediate, rather than phosphorylation coupled to any sort of an electron transport chain.

As previously indicated, anaerobic growth of commonly aerobic, but facultative, bacteria has also provided YATP values near 10.5 Growth of A. aerogenes was observed by Hadjipetrou et al (50) to yield 26.1 g of cells per mole of glucose fermented. Based on the assumption that 1.71 moles of ATP arose from glycolysis and 0.84 from conversion of pyruvate to acetate, the YATP was calculated to be 10.2.

It is reasonable to ask if YATP would remain constant under different conditions of growth. This question was investigated by Hernandez & Johnson (57) who observed that fermentation products of glucose accumulated by A. cloacae were quantitatively different in cultures incubated at pH 5.0 and at 7.2. Specifically, they noted a 14-fold increase in the production of acetate at pH 7.2 over that at 5.0 and, simultaneously, a 17-fold increase in the accumulation of 2,3-butanediol at pH 5.0 over that at pH 7.2. Because consumption of equivalent amounts of glucose provided approximately 1.5 times as much ATP at the higher pH than the lower, they reasoned that the YATP must be identical at each pH if it is a valid constant. And, it was found that values resulting from these studies were indeed both well within the acceptable range and nearly identical at 11.6 for pH 5.0 and 11.5 for pH 7.2.

A slightly lower YATP of 9.4 was obtained for the anaerobic growth of E. coli on glucose at pH 7.0. A point in this study (57) that deserves particular notice is the requirement they discovered for nutritional supplementation of the minimal medium with amino acids and yeast extract in order to reach this figure for YATP for the anaerobically grown E. coli. Unexpectedly, nutritional factors other than need for ATP were shown to limit anaerobic growth of this bacterium which is so markedly prototrophic as an aerobe.

Smalley, Jahrling & Van Demark (123) observed a YATP of 10.75 as would be expected for S. faecalis grown anaerobically on glucose. When the organism was then grown aerobically on mannitol, an increase of 7.3 g in the yield of cells was obtained per mole of mannitol over that realized for each mole of glucose utilized. Mannitol-l-phosphatc:NAD oxidoreductase

was demonstrated in extracts of mannitol-grown cells, and the 7.3-g increase was attributed to energy provided by phosphorylation linked to electron transport rather than substrate phosphorylation. Aerobic growth at the expense of glucose was found to yield a greater quantity of cells than could be accounted for by substrate phosphorylation alone. The argument took this direction: Y�r��g�� was S8 g X mole-1• If 2 moles of ATP were gained in the conversion of glucose to pyruvate and 2 more from the conversion of pyruvate to acetate and CO2 (as carbon balances suggested) for a total of 4, Y;i���:: should be (10.5 X 4) or 42, rather than 58. The additional 16-g yield of cells was attributed to the productivity of ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation, which has been demonstrated, these authors and others indicated, in aerobically grown S. faecalis and Streptococcus agalactiae (44, 54, 87). Their argument in favor of additional ATP thus hinges on whether YATP is indeed 10.5 for aerobic cultures, or whether it is higher. A YATP of 14.5 would be required to explain the Y;i'���;; of S8 unless an additional source of ATP were found.

Other results consistent with the occurrence of oxidative phosphorylation in S. faecalis have now been reported. Bryan-Jones & Whittenbury (17) obtained YATP values of 9 for anaerobic growth of S. faecalis on glucose and fructose. When cells were grown aerobically with hematin, the cell yield indicated a trebling of the production of ATP for each mole of substrate utilized. Cell-free preparations of the bacteria grown on the media containing hematin were found to contain "b" type cytochromes. Moreover, oxidations in the extracts were sensitive to KCN, NaNa, and antimycin A.

It seems clear now that a sufficient number of confirmations of YATP values approximating 10.5 have been obtained to sustain acceptance of its correlation with predetermined and relatively uncomplicated catabolic pa thways in many organisms. In addition, it is highly probable that inferen tial use of YATP together with data on enzymes is appropriate as a basis for justifying the proposal of several phosphorylating reactions in addition to those generally thought to supply the total energy budget for anaerobes. Attempts to correlate energy conversion and biosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria have now been undertaken, centering attention on "ATP pools" (34, 125); but there is dissonance yet in a number of reports concerning yields of heterotrophs. These differences must be acknowledged and possibly reconciled.

Oddly enough, one group of workers (136) has included a value for YATP in calculations designed to confirm substrate phosphorylation rather than electron transport-linked phosphorylation in an anaerobe; whereas another (123) has employed 10.5 for YATP in evaluations that undergird an argument for electron transport-linked phosphorylation in aerobically growing, but ordinarily cytochrome-less, streptococci. Both seem plausible, as they are presented.

### VALVES NOT IN ACCORD

Although YATP was found in the original work of Bauchop & Elsden (8)

to average 10.5 for S. faecalis, S. cervisiae, and P. lindneri (Z. mobilis), their value for Propionibacter pentosaceum was higher than would be expected on the basis of the number of moles of ATP thought to be generated by the propionic acid fermentation. Whereas it was assumed that 3 moles of ATP were produced per 1.5 moles of glucose catabolized (148), the Ygluco •• obtained was twice the expected. This seeming paradox suggests a need for 6 moles of ATP per 1.5 moles of glucose to account for the yield of cells harvested. Although it has been postulated that additional ATP may be supplied in the fermentation of ethanol by C. kluyveri by a substrate-linked phosphorylation in the generation of H2 (116), the problem of how additional ATP may be gained in the propionic acid fermentation has not been resolved.

Even so, it does seem that certain of the other elevated YATP values that have been reported can be reasonably explained. For example, Hungate (63) observed an apparently elevated Y cellobiose for an anaerobic rumen isolate, Ruminococcus albus. But, subtracting the weight of storage products enabled him to correct his YcellobioBe to 102 gXmole-1. Further, the postulation of a phosphoroclastic split of cellobiose and demonstration of the production of 4 moles of acetate per mole of the disaccharide fermented were presumed to account for generation of 9 moles of ATP per mole of cellobiose catabolized. An acceptable YATP of 11.3 would then result.

In the work of Brown (16), growth in a routinely employed complex medium at the expense of glucose in static culture provided the expected YATP values for Lactobacillus casei and L. plantarum. Variations were then observed in yields from shaken cultures of the bacteria. But, these differences were found by experiments with 14C-Iabeled glucose to result from assimilation in the agitated cultures of a significant quantity of glucose carbon; and assumption of an elevated YATP was thus not justified.

Certain other results at odds with the predicted have not been so easily explained away, however. As a prime example, Hobson (59) obtained the expected molar yields in one part of his work but not in another. If it were assumed that 2 moles of ATP were produced per mole of either substrate fermented, yields of a lipolytic bacterium 5s cultured anaerobically in a chemostat on glycerol and Selenomonas ruminantium batch-cultured anaerobically on glucose provided data from which the expected YATP values of 10-11 were calculated. But a significant change occurred in the continuous culture of the sclenomonad where Yglucose was found to be 62 g Xmolc1 at optimum dilution rates. Given this datum, calculations in agreement with a YATP of 10.5 would require that 5 to 6 moles of ATP be realized per mole of glucose catabolized. According to the author, neither assimilation of glucose carbon, accumulation of storage products, fermentation of the amino acids in the complex medium, or secondary fermentation of lactate would be likely explanations for the high yields. In later studies, additional values apparently greater than 10.5 were obtained for bacterium 5s grown on fructose and for Bacteroides amylophilus on maltose (60). It was thus suggested that 10.5 may not be universally valid as an approximation of YATP. On the other

hand, an elevated Yglucose that was proposed by Beck & Shugart (10) for S. Jaecalis var. liqueJaciens Seems more likely to be explained by the partially aerobic conditions employed during growth than an inconstancy of YATP. Loy & Beck (77) have since reported enzymatic patterns for dissimilation of glucose and arginine that permit calculations of 12 to 13 for YATP for this bacterium.

Yields of Actinomyces naeslundii anaerobically grown in a complex culture medium at the expense of glucose and glucose+malate were, respectively, 12.3 and 10.1 g per ATP synthesized (18). When CO2 was added to the complex medium, however, the apparent YATP was increased approximately 1.5-fold. In the presence of both CO2, and oxygen, YATP was increased twofold, according to the estimates made by the authors of moles of ATP generated per mole of glucose utilized.

Since Gunsalus & Shuster (49) calculated that YATP could theoretically be as great as 33, it has been argued that values significantly greater than 10.5 might well be expected. But, the case for higher YATP values is weakened by the fact that under those cultural conditions where the molar quantity of ATP produced is unquestionably established, even S. ruminantium, bacterium Ss (SO) and A. naeslundii (18) werc observed to have YATP values near 10.5. Arguing for acceptance of an inconsistent YATP would seem to call for belief in a more efficient use of the energy of a specific quantity of ATP by ditr�rent types of bacteria or, within the same wild-type species or strain, from one culture to another. In support of this viewpoint, the suggestion was made that propionibacteria and actinomycetes may well be members of a group of bacteria capable of just such increased efficiency (18). It does seem, however, that continuing to search for unrecognized, perhaps novel, means of generating high-energy phosphate bonds is a more promising course to follow than abandoning YATP = 10.5 as a reliable factor.

Forrest (41) demonstrated a YATP value of 8.3 for Z. mobilis, a figure considered close enough for agreement with Bauchop & Elsden's estimate. This value remained constant at 8.3 in cultures incubated over a considerable temperature range but dropped sharply in those incubated at temperatures above 33°C. Conversely, YATP for S. Jaecalis was constant for cultures subjected to temperatures above 30°C but decreased in those held at lower temperatures. These instances were presented as clear examples of uncoupling of anabolic and catabolic processes by unfavorable incubation temperatures, and YATP was presumed to have changed only when an uncoupling temperature was encountered.

In other studies, Forrest & Walker (42) found YglucoBe for S. faecalis to be increased 1.5-fold over the expected value if less than 6 tLmoles X ml-1 of glucose were provided. The value was found to reach 21 g X mole-1 as expected only if more than 6 Mmoles of glucose were supplied in the culture medium. This observation placed the validity of a consistent YAPT in question for cultures with small substrate concentrations.

Moustafa & Collins (96) have since reported molar growth yields for

Streptococcus diacetilactis on glucose, galactose, maltose, and lactose and S. cremoris, S. lactis, and S. faecalis on glucose that would require YATP values averaging 17 if their estimates of molar production of ATP are correct. To obtain these seemingly elevated values, it was necessary that small concentrations of substrate be used and, further, that dry weight be determined after only 6 hr of culture time had elapsed. Yurginine (which is equal to YATP since only 1 mole of ATP is presumed to be formed per mole of arginine fermented) was estimated to be 17.8. Similarly, Ypyruvate was postulated to be 17.3, if 15 JLmoles of substrate per ml or less were provided as energy source (97). Autolysis was credited with diminishing the Y.ubBtrate values observed for older cultures and was said to be most markedly effective in those containing the smaller quantities of substrate.

Hempfling, Mainzer & Van Demark (54) have countered with the argument that YATP for S.faecalis is actually invariant. They have asserted that, instead of the expected lactic fermentation, patterns change as glucoselimiting conditions are imposed during anaerobic growth. In their studies, acetate and ethanol were discerned as products of fermentation when the smaller concentrations of glucose were provided. Rather than accepting the probable generation of 2 moles of ATP per mole of glucose fermented, they equated ATP production to the number of moles of acetate recovered. On this assumption, the average YATP for seven different glucose-limiting concentrations in a chemostat was then found to be 1 1.1. The question of the number of moles of ATP produced by cells growing on low concentrations of substrate is clearly the central issue in this dispute.

# GROWTH YIELDS FROM AEROBIC CULTURES Y ATP BASED ON ASSUMED YIELDS OF ATP

Molar production of ATP in aerobic cultures may only be estimated and not determined. Although this value is a function in aerobes of the quantity of oxygen taken up, it is not a constant. A portion of the oxygen consumed during growth does not participate in many cases in oxidative phosphorylation. Oxygen atoms used for hydroxylation and cleavage of ring compounds and decarboxylations of amino acids are cases in point (53, 146). Several investigators attempting to relate ATP production and cell yield in aerobes have resorted, therefore, to reasonable estimates of ATP gains based (i) on oxygen consumed, (ii) on values for P /0 ratios obtained with cell-free extracts, and at times (iii) on fragmentary knowledge of the components of the electron chain in the organism under study. At best, their figures can be considered no more than approximations as long as the actual quantities of ATP generated aerobically can not be measured.

In one of the better conceived studies, Stouthamer (130) made effective use of the difference in the molar growth yield of Gluconobacter liquefaciens cultured on ethanol and on acetate as an indication of the yield representing the energy provided by the oxidation of ethanol to acetate. Since he found the difference in molar growth yield to be 2 g and the moles of ATP produced per

mole of ethanol utilized was taken from P /0 ratios to be 0.2, he reasoned that YATP would be 2/0.2 or 10. Reasoning similarly, Stouthamer obtained a YATP of 11 for the difference in yield between lactate and acetate.

Chen (25) employed the proposed maximal yield of 38 moles of ATP from the oxidation through the tricarboxylic acid cycle of a mole of glucose to calculate a probable YATP of 10.96 for Torulopsis utilis. Inspection of the same sort of figures suggested a value of only 6.21 for aerobically grown S. cerevisiae, but complete oxidation of that fraction of the carbon of glucose not assimilated was assumed in obtaining these figures. Except at specific low initial concentrations of glucose with strong aeration provided (9, 83), this probably does not occur; and Chen's estimates of ATP production for S. cerevisiae may thus have been high.

Hadjipetrou & Stouthamer (51) have calculated that yields of ATP in glucose-utilizing, nitrate-respiring A. aerogenes approximate those produced by respiration of oxygen. The results of their studies were complicated by the smaller than expected yields from growth on mannitol. Three values (molar growth yield, moles of nitrate reduced and moles of acetate accumulated) were employed in their calculations.

Other investigators have approached the problem of obtaining Y1"f�iC by calculating the most prohable P /0 ratios for bacteria growing on a variety of substrates. Their figures have been based on the Y02 values they obtained. Hernandez & Johnson (58) found a P /0 ratio of 1.0 most agreeable with dry cell yields of P. fluorescens from minimal media. YATP values of 10.2 to 12.6 were suggested from harvests obtained from growth on lactate, malate, citrate, and glucose; but even the best yields from growth on ethanol and acetate inferred YATP values of only 6.8 and 7.3, assuming a P /0 of 1.0. Yields from culture of Candida utilis on glucose were consistent with acceptance of a P /0 ratio of 2.0 for oxidation of glucose, but only 1.0 for ethanol and acetate. P /0 ratios of 1.0 were suggested as well from yields of A. cloacae, E. coli, or Saccharomyces carlsbergensis grown on glucose. On the basis of yields from cultures of two soil pseudomonads in minimal media, Prochazka, Mayberry & Payne (110) speculated that the P /0 ratios for growth on benzoate, phenylacetate, and dodecanol were approximately 2.0; whereas a ratio of approximately 1.0 was considered most appropriate for yields from di-, trio, and tetraethylene glycols.

To account for the possibility that the P/O ratios might be only approximately and not exactly 2.0 and 1.0, Mayberry, Prochazka & Payne (85) then proposed that two assumptions concerning ATP production be made: (i) Y02 values for each substrate can be rank-ordered relative to that for acetate (set arbitrarily at 1.00) and (ii) a P/O ratio of exactly 1.0 can be assumed for growth on acetate. With this done, a value can be calculated for moles of ATP per mole of oxygen consumed [ATPX(mole O2)-1]. The figure is found in each case to be other than an integer. From this, constant YATP values may then be calculated for growth of prototrophs on a variety of simple substrates. For example, Y02 for succinate was found to be 31.4 and ATP X(mole O2)-1 was assumed to be 2.94. Thus:

$$\begin{split} Y_{\mathsf{ATP}} &= \frac{Y_{\mathsf{O_2}}}{\mathsf{ATP} \, \mathsf{X} \, \mathsf{(mole\, O_2\)}^{-1}} = \frac{31.4 \,\mathsf{g} \, \mathsf{X} \, \mathsf{(mole\, O_2\)}^{-1}}{2.94 \,\mathsf{(mole\,ATP)} \, \mathsf{X} \, \mathsf{(mole\, O_2\)}^{-1}} \\ &= 10.68 \,\mathsf{g} \, \mathsf{X} \, \mathsf{(mole\,ATP)}^{-1} \end{split}$$

Calculations based on yields from aerobic growth on the variety of substrates utilized by Mayberry, Prochazka & Payne (85) and Hadjipetrou et al (50) resulted in YATP values similarly very near 10.7 (Table 1).

Admittedly, the values in this table were obtained by treatment of data with an answer in mind; but, if (i) the P /0 ratio for acetate actually is 1.0 for prototrophs as suggested (58), and (ii) the noninteger ATP X (mole O2)-1 values obtained for other substrates by reference to acetate's value are valid (as seems likely), YATP for aerobes would indeed lie between 10 and 11. Refences of ATP X (mole O2)-1 values to a standard in this manner would eliminate from consideration the complicating influence of the oxygen consumed by oxygenases or any reactions other than cell-producing oxidative phosphorylation and would demarcate only that part of oxygen uptake which promotes energy for biosynthesis.

TABLE 1. Y..lTP VALUES CALCULATED FROM Y02 DATA, ASSUMING P /0 = 1 FOR GROWTH ON ACETATE

# YIELDS BASED ON ELECTRONS AVAILABLE IN SUBSTRATES ( Yav e- )

Any organic substrate may be:characterized by its constituent number of av e- (71, 72). As previously indicated, glucose is a 24-av e- compound as well as a hexose. Benzoate is a 30-au e- substrate as well as a 7 -carbon aromatic acid-and thus for any other organic compound. Yields based on this property are easily calculated- molar yield in grams ( Ysub) is divided by av e- per mole to obtain the Va. e- ' Using this procedure, Mayberry, Prochazka & Payne (84) found that when they examined the yields of soil pseudomonads that completely consumed a variety of substrates from which cells and CO2 were the only significant products, all of the Va. e - values fell near 3.0. Specifically, the mean Va. e - derived from their investigations was 3.14 ± 0.11.

These workers emphasized that, for precision in studies of this sort, a number of restrictions must be observed. The dry weight determinations of yield must be made as soon as oxygen uptake in the culture no longer increases logarithmically with time (38, 78, 79, 84» and exact accounting for the quantity of substrate consumed must be obtained at that time to avoid weight loss owing to endogenous respiration. Moreover, the nitrogen source required for these experiments is ammonium ion rather than either organic or less well-reduced inorganic forms of nitrogen. Cells fixing nitrogen may require as much as 20 times the expenditure of ATP as cells using reduced nitrogen (28). Few data are available, but examination of yields from two reports have p rovided Y��-: fixing values of 0.35 for Azotobacter chroococcum (29) and 0.51 for Azotobacter vinelandii (99). In addition, productivity of A. aerogenes obtained at the expense of nitrate nitrogen was less than yields obtained in equivalent cultures containing ammonium ion (51) as nitrogen source.

B ut, with the proper conditions provided, it may thus be strongly inferred that the Ya• e - for prototrophic growth will approximate 3.14, irrespective of the organism or the substrate (84). And, considering several studies in which the exact determination of yield of cells per unit of substrate utilized was the primary objective, data closely consistent with this hypothesis have been obtained. As early as 1940, Hoover & Allison (61) obtained yields of Rhizobium meliloti grown on sucrose from which a Ya •• - of 3.0 has now been derived. Some years later, maximum yields of Serratia marcescens obtained from fully aerated media containing mixtures of different concentrations of citrate and glucose gave an average Ya •• - of 3. 15 (124). Further, Pirt (108) obtained a maximal yield of A. cloacae from glucose in a chemostat with a Ya •• - of 3.30, and Herbert and his associates (55, 56) obtained yields from continuous cultures of A. aerogenes and cloacae on glycerol that provided Ya• e - values of 3.41 and 3.44, respectively. The studies of Hadjipetrou and his colleagues (50, 51) with A. aero genes are the most extensive yet reported. These investigators employed 29 growth-supporting substrates of which 19 were well utilized by these bacteria. Ya" .- valUeS calculated for

these 19 ranged from 2.61 to 3.75 with a mean of 3.06. Johnson and others (58, 143) reported yields of C. utilis and P. fluorescens from culture on five substrates with a mean of 2.89. Dawes and his associates (66, 78, 81) obtained yields of P. aeruginosa from growth on 13 substrates supplying a mean Ya• e - of 3.09. Finally, the mean for all these values is 3.07, which is probably not significantly different from the predicted mean, 3.14.

I t should now be recalled that these are restricted results taken only from those investigations in which determination of cell yield was a principal intent of the experimenters who optimized conditions to obtain the best yields. What values would be obtained if acceptance of the data were subject to less exacting criteria? If requirements for estimating dry weight of cells, measuring oxygen uptake, determining exact quantity of substrate utilized, and assaying for possible end products were not so rigidly specified? I t is apparent (Table 2) that even if restrictions are loosened and a variety of data are considered [including those for yields from S. cerevisiae (9, 83) and Neurospora crassa (134) in minimally supplemented media as well as yields from a nutritionally supplemented auxotrophic culture of Bacillus subtilis (4)J most Ya• e - values lie near 3. 14. Considering the results from 79 experiments, only 11 values were found to lie below 2.64 and 10 to lie above 3.64. Thus, 73 percent of the values are within these limits. The mean Y" •• value was again found to be 3.07 for all the values considered, just as it was for those in the restricted group.

A potentially useful tool for the bacterial geneticist may be found in this analysis. The restoration, by nutritional supplement, of prototrophic growth yield ( Ya •• - = 3.39) for a mutant strain of B. subtilis (4) suggests that a measure of how thoroughly any nutrilite or combination of factors restores an auxotrophic mutant to prototrophy can be obtained by determining how closely the nutrilite can restore the Ya •• - to that of a wild-type culture.

### YIELDS BASED ON TOTAL ENERGY TAKEN FROM THE MEDIUM ( Ykcaz )

For the growth of bacteria in any culture medium, it is clear that the total energy consumed (Ee) from the medium must be the sum of that incorporated biosynthetically into cellular material (Ea) and that expended by catabolism (Ed)' This is true for cultures in simple or complex media, for aerobic or anaerobic growth.

A good approximation of the quantity Ea for any sort of growth is provided by measuring the heat of combustion of a unit quantity of dry cells. An Ea of 5.3 kcal per gram dry weight of cells has been observed (85). [Earlier estimates (147) of the energy content of bacteria varied greatly, but most likely because of crude methods of harvesting, i.e., "precipitation with iron."] On a molar basis, En would thus be approximately 5.3 X Ysubstrate'

There are two procedures for obtaining acceptable values for Ed. First, in either a simple medium, where the organic substrate serves as source of both carbon and energy, or in a complex medium, in which the amount of a

• These values represent fractions of moles of the substrates provided in this experiment and not values per mole of either glucose or citrate.

specific substrate oxidized during growth can be determined, Ed is estimated by multiplying the moles of oxygen consumed per mole of substrate utilized (02 X sub-I) by 106 kcal X mole-1 [the latter value is the average quantity of energy available from the transfer of four equivalents of electron from an "organic" source to reduce 1 mole of O2, as previously explained (84, 85) ]. Second, in either type of medium with fermentative catabolism, an acceptable approximation for Ed is the difference between the heat of combustion of the original substrate and that for the sum of the end products-each on a molar basis.

If these representations are correct, the yield of bacterial cells in grams dry weight per kilocalorie of energy involved ( Ykcal) should then be predictable according to this eq ua tion :

$$Y_{kcal} = \frac{Y_{\{g\}}}{E_{\text{e}}\,\text{(kcal)}} \equiv \frac{Y \,\text{(g dry weight of cells)}}{E_{a} + E_{d}}$$

Previous work (84) led us to the general prediction for heterotrophs that:

$$Y_{load} = \frac{Y_{av \text{ } \text{ } ^\text{-}}}{E_{\text{e}}} = \frac{3.14 \text{ g} \times (av \text{ } \text{e}^-)^{-1}}{26.5 \text{ } kcal \times (av \text{ } \text{e}^-)^{-1}} = 0.118 \text{ g} \times kcal^{-1}$$

How closely data from experiments performed by us and by others agree with this prediction may be seen from the calculations which follow.

Because of historical development, let us look first at yields for anaerobic growth. According to Bauchop & Elsden (8), growth of anaerobic organisms yielded 21-23 g cells per mole of glucose consumed while converting that mole of glucose presumably into either 2 moles of lactate or 2 moles each of ethanol and carbon dioxide and into a form of energy available for synthesis, The heat of combustion of glucose (71) is 673 kcal X mole-I; of lactate, 326; of ethanol, 327.6 ; and of C02, 0.0. For these fermentations of glucose, Ed would be approximated then as follows:

$$\text{for latate, } E_d = 673 - 2 \text{(326)} = 21 \text{ kcal} \times \text{mol} \text{c}^{-1}$$

$$\text{for ethanol, } E_{\bullet} = 673 - 2 \text{(327.6) = 17.8 } kcal \text{ \textdegree mole } \text{^{-1}}$$

The Ea values would thus be:

for S. faeealis,

Ea = (22 g X mole-I) X (5.3 keal X g-l) for S. eerevisiae, 117 keal X molel

Ea = (21 g X mole-I) X (5.3 keal X g-l) = 1 11.3 keal X mole-l

Therefore, for S. faecalis fermenting glucose to lactate:

$$Y_{kal} = \frac{\cdot}{117 \cdot kcal \times mole^{-1}} \stackrel{\text{22 g } \gtrless \text{ mole^{-1}}}{\text{ mole^{-1}} + \text{21 } kcal \times mole^{-1}} \cdots = 0.159 \text{ g} \times kcal^{-1}$$

and for S. cerevisiae fermenting glucose to ethanol and CO2,

$$Y_{kal} = \frac{21 \text{ g} \times \text{mole}^{-1}}{111.3 \text{ kcal} \times \text{mole}^{-1} + 17.8 \text{ kcal} \times \text{mole}^{-1}} \cdot \frac{\dots}{\text{mole}^{-1}} = 0.163 \text{ g} \times kcal^{-1}$$

Further, Yarginine for S. faecalis was found to be approximately 10.5 g X mole-I when a mole of arginine was converted presumably to one mole of ornithine, two of CO2, and two of NHa. Then :

$$\text{for arginine, } Y_{kal} = 0.142 \text{ g} \times kcal^{-1}.$$

Data for other bacteria and additional substrates are presented in Table 3, and the mean Ykcal is calculated to be O.130 g X kcal-1 for anaerobic growth.

Observing aerobic cultures, Smalley, Jahrling & Van Demark found that S. faeealis converted one mole of glucose to 0.18 moles of lactate, 0.025 of acetoin, 1.7 of acetate, and 1.7 of CO2• Yg\uco.e was 58.2 g X mole-I. Therefore :

• Assuming carbon not accounted [or in the products by the authors was present as formate or CO2 (resulting from the action of formic hydrogenlyase) and further that cells were 47% carbon [39 .2 miIIiatoms CX(g cells)-l].

$$Y_{kal} = 0.105 \text{ g} \times kcal^{-1}$$

Growth on mannitol yielded 0.166 moles of lactate, 0.17 of acetoin, 1.83 of acetate, and 1.83 of CO2 with a Ymannitol Of 64.6 g X mole-1• From this we may calculate:

$$Y_{k\text{eq }l} = 0.104 \text{ g} \times kcd^{-1}$$

Using data obtained in this laboratory (84) for the aerobic growth of bacteria, where Ybenzote was 86.8 g X mole-1 and O2 X sub-1 was 3.46 mole X mole-I, we obtain:

for benzoate,

$$E_a = 86.8 \text{(g \times mole^{-1})} \times \text{(5.3 kcal} \times \text{g}^{-1}) = 460 \text{ kcal} \times \text{mole}^{-1}$$

$$E_d = \text{(106 kcal} \times \text{mole}^{-1}) \times \text{(3.46 mole \times mole^{-1})} = 366 \text{ kcal} \times \text{mole}^{-1}$$

$$Y_{kal} = \frac{86.8 \text{ g } \times \text{mole}^{-1}}{\text{(460 kcal \times mole^{-1})} + 366 \text{ kcal} \times \text{mole}^{+1}} = 0.105 \text{ g } \times kcal^{-1}$$

It was mentioned before that the term 106 kcal X mole-l is the average value for transfer of 4 a'll e- from organic compounds to oxygen [26.5 kcal X (a'll e-)-1] X [4 a'll e- X (mole O2)-1]. Applying similar calculations to the data for the other organisms and substrates utilized, we obtain the results (along with those detailed above) presented in Table 2.

The mean Ykcal for anaerobic growth derived from various sources and considered here (0.130 g X keat-1) is slightly higher than that for aerobic cultures (mean of 0.116), but neither of these figures is strikingly different from 0.118. The mean Ykcal for combined anaerobic and aerobic yields is very close at 0.119 g X kcat-l to the predicted value.

### YmLDS FROM MIxED CuLTURES

Cultures containing a variety of aerobic organisms derived from sewage and soil responded like pure cultures of heterotrophs in minimal media containing limiting quantities of "pure biochemicals" (24, 47, 112, 119, 120). The mean Va. 8- for these experiments, 2.94, approximates the predicted 3.14 quite closely (Table 4). The mean Ya •• - for both mixed and pure cultures is 3.03. With additional consistency, the mean Ykcal for these mixed cultures, 0. 110, was also found to lie near the predicted value, 0.118. Finally, the mean for all the values for aerobic and anaerobic pure, and aerobic mixed, cultures considered together is 0.1 17.

Despite the variety of organisms that were employed, this should not be surprising. It may be recalled that Servizi & Bogan ( 119, 120) deduced from experimentally derived cell yields and assumed productivity of ATP that, for aromatics, alcohols, and aliphatic acids, a yield value with the same units as our Ykcaz would be 0.104; and for carbohydrates and Krebs cycle intermediates it would be 0.116. These predictions fall very close to or identify with both the mean and predicted Ykcal values stemming from calculations

# GROWTH ON HYDROCARBONS SINGLE-CELL PROTEIN

A variety of microorganisms can transform long-chained petroleum fractions and methane into protein. Use of nutritious material so produced to supplement the diets of humans and domestic animals has been recommended as a possible means of alleviating the world's food shortage (98, 101, 132) . Protein synthesized by microorganisms is often designated "single-cell protein" (SCP) to distinguish it from green plant material produced agriculturally, particularly when the microbial cells are grown on hydrocarbons (22). Pilot scale production of SCP has begun in several countries (65. 80, 1 49).

Johnson (68) recently reviewed the technical problems involved in produc tion of SCP and indicated that provision of sufficient oxygen during growth may constitute the most difficult aspect of the operation. Other readily recognizable difficulties include : (i) finding methods for dissipating the heat produced by microbial metabolism ; (ii) protecting against the possible intrusion of bacteriophages ; and (iii) carrying out feeding trials with human volunteers to determine whether the nitrogenous components of bacterial cell walls and other fractions are bland and digestible or if they

may be toxic. All these represent problems to be solved before large-scale operations will be economically feasible. Use of a hydrocarbon-utilizing, thermophilic Bacillus species has been suggested (82) as a means of overcoming one of these difficulties by obviating the need for cooling the growth fermenter.

Human volunteers were found in a recent study (145) to tolerate very poorly a period of feeding on powdered Hydrogenomonas and A erobacter cells, although rodents were not adversely affected by eating these materials. If it were widespread, toxicity of SCP would certainly represent the most serious of all obstacles to adoption of this seemingly promising remedy for food shortage.

Bunker (21) has reviewed past efforts at producing and using SCPo Current production figures, particularly for yields of C. utilis, were cited as encouraging indicators of good prospects for future use of microbial food. A more recent and thorough review has now been published (22).

### CALCULATION OF YmLDS

Monod's convention (90) for expressing yields in terms of grams of ceJIs per gram of substrate utilized is generally accepted (39, 68, 88, 89) for the presentation of data on yields derived from bacterial cultures on hydrocarbon substrates. Thus, a harvest of 100 g of cells per 100 g of substrate consumed may be designated as a yield of 100 percent. Vary & Johnson ( 143) expressed yields in the units of that convention for a "bacterium H R" grown on methane. Yon, averaged 62 percent. When Yon, is converted to a molar basis ( Yroethane) , Yaw .-, and Ykcal values may then be calculated.

The quantity of methane utilized during growth was precisely determined by Vary & Johnson, but carbon balances were not obtained when methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl alcohols were the substrates employed. Oxygen consumption was much greater than expected with these substrates. Apparently, the organism catabolized them like hydrocarbons (i.e., 75 percent of the carbon was oxidized) . It thus may be postulated from this report that : (i) for methane, it is appropriate to calculate Yaw .- and Ykcal, but the values (1.25 and 0.046, respectively) are smaller than would be expected from studies with conventional substrates; (ii) for the alcohols, it may be appropriate to calculate values as if these were hydrocarbons ( Ya• e- for methanol, 1.76 ; ethanol, 1.72; propanol, 1.43 ; and butanol, 1.47) and ( Ykcal for methanol, 0.062 ; for ethanol, 0.062; for propanol, 0.05 1; and for butanol, 0.060) ; and (iii) for glucose, Ya •• - and Ykcal values are very close to those that would be predicted (84) for any prototroph growing on a carbohydrate (3.00 and 0.105, respectively).

Some insight into the basis for the low yield values for methane and the alcohols is provided as suggested j ust above by inspection of the data on oxygen uptake presented by Vary & Johnson (143). Whereas other workers (23, 24, 55, 1 18) have reported incorporation of approximately 60 percent of the ca.rbon of substra.tes such as glucose and glycerol at the expense of the

oxidized 40 percent, bacterium HR oxidized to CO2 approximately 75 percent of the methane and alcohol carbon provided and incorporated only 2S percent. A greater demand for oxygen would logically be expected when a hydrocarbon is the sole carbon source since many of the carbohydrates, amino acids, and other cellular components are oxygenated compounds. Fixation of oxygen, as wel! as respiration utilization, must certainly occur.

In many cases, calculations of yields based on av e- and kcal for harvests of cells grown on hydrocarbons can be only uncertainly derived. Key data are not presented in a number of reports. For example, in one detailed study of effective gaseous mixes, the quantity of methane utilized was not determined, although dry weight of cells per liter of culture and other useful data on gas mix ratios were presented (52) Further difficulty stems in other experiments as well from the lack of quantitative yields based on moles of hydrocarbon actually used as opposed to moles provided (89, 149). Accumulation in culture media of long-chained esters that are but slowly dissimilated (128) presents a further impediment to applying analyses such as ours which depend on accounting for the number of substrate electrons and quantities of all intermediates. Finally, it seems certain that the richest potential source of information is likely to remain closed to review. Yields obtained in the production plants established by the major oil companies have not been, and probably will not be, released in significant volume for publication.

Relatively little of the enzymology of hydrocarbon catabolism has been elucidated (36, 40, 43, 67, 73, 74, 140). Without more detailed analyses of pathways, we are not likely to be able to measure either the molar quantity of ATP synthesized at the expense of hydrocarbon oxidized or, of course, YATP.

Data are available, however, from experiments in several laboratories from which calculations of Ya •• - values may be obtained for growth on longchained hydrocarbons. If we assume that yields from growth on those compounds employed or referred to by Johnson (69), Miller & Johnson (88), Ertola, Lilly & Webb (39), Yamada et al (149), and Wagner, Kleeman & Zahn (144) are general!y representative of yield per mole of hydrocarbon substrate utilized (Table 5), then the mean Va. e- is 2.05 for bacteria and yeasts. Yields obtained by Silverman, Gordon & Wender (122) were not considered because nitrate served as thte sole nitrogen source in their experiments.

The decidedly lower Ya •• - values from growth on methane and the longchained hydrocarbons, the excessive demands for oxygen, and the costs of stirring and cooling during industrial fermentation may prove to offset the attractiveness of the low cost of the substrates as an advantage for production of SCPo On the other hand, the general availability of hydrocarbon substrates (often now disposed of wastefully) in areas where food supply is poor, considered with the fact that SCP production is a nonagricultural process independent of environment and weather, is offered by Norris (101) as an attraction to the development of productive microbiological methods by

### CONCLUSIONS

Bail (3) concluded from studies of growth that, for any species of bacteria, the number of viable cells per unit volume in a cul tu re incubated under standardized conditions in standardized liquid medium is always very nearly the same when the growth curve reaches the stationary phase. This specific property has been termed the M concentration. Smith & Johnson (124) tound, however, that a colorless but still prototrophic mutant of S. marcescens yielded a smaller M concentration than the pigmented wild type of the same species when each was cultured under identical conditions. Microscopic inspection revealed that the nonpigmented cells were larger than the colored ; but, most significantly, it was found that the yield in dry weight from standardized medium was identical for both. The M concentration thus appears to be more exactly in terpreted in terms of dry weight than numbers of viable cells, and in light of the consistency of many of the YATP, Ya •• -, and Ykcal values presented here, to be an interspecific property precisely relatable in a significant number of isolates and mixed populations to the available energy taken from the culture medium. Fine control mechanisms such as catabolite repression and allosteric effects (92, 127, 139, 150), nucleotide effects (107), and energy charge (2) appear to function within the limits these growth yields delineate for us.

One of the intriguing aspects of the discernment of these limits is the uncertainty we must now feel as to whether they are imposed upon the cell as a gross control, or whether they result from the functioning, in concert, of the various fine controls. Although limits of growth have been experimentally correlated in the current review with several functions of available energy, it is not necessary to conclude that these functions serve to set down rather than simply to mark off the limits. It is conceivable that one of the fine control mechanisms has central control and exerts influence analogous to the hypophysial direction of hormonal action in h uman metabolism.

If the limits of prototrophic bacterial growth are imposed, so that fine controls have been evolved to exert their influence within them to prevent going beyond a certain quantity of growth yield, it would be reasonable to assume that the limits are genetically predetermined-that there exists a gene controlling the "investment-expenditure" budget for energy. The recurrent observations (24, 55, 85, 118, 135) of the assimilation of approximately 60 percent and oxidative expenditure of the remainder of the carbon, energy or electrons of substrates utilized (either during various short intervals of time between initiation of growth and the upper log phase or during continuous culture) are consistent with the existence of such a prede termining budget gene. But the control exerted by the effectors of rate of enzyme function precludes unquestioning acceptance of this notion. Judgement must await identification of the entire array of effectors and further study of their interactions.

Separation that would permit examination of each of the functions of a hypothetical budget gene seems more likely to be possible with nutritionally fastidious bacteria than with the less- demanding. Investment and expenditure of energy may actually be controlled separately in the nutritionally demanding organisms (115). In keeping with this suggestion, Forrest (41) found that adverse temperatures of incubation appeared to separate biosyntheses from production of useful energy in the auxotrophical-Iy growing bacteria, Z. mobilis and S. faecalis. ATP production continued unabated when biosynthesis was slowed. On the other hand, when a single source of both carbon and energy is employed, the two functions may not separate. Baschnagel-DePamphilis & Hanson (4) observed that coupling between catabolism and anabolism was not loosened by nutrilite limitation (NH4+, tryptophan) in cultures of a mutant strain of B. subtilis using glucose as both carbon and energy source.

Generalizations concerning yields from ordinary substrates do not apply quantitatively to growth on methane or long-chained hydrocarbons; but, even for the hydrocarbons, yields are p�edjctably correlated with substrate av e-. An average yield only 65 percent as great may be expected from growth on a hydrocarbon as compared with the productivity of a conventional substrate. Thus, the quantity of enthalpy converted to entropy is considerably more than the 38 percent expected during growth on the usual minimal medium (85). As much as 60 percent of the enthalpy of the hydrocarbon may be lost in the conversion of these substances to cells.
